This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task used to determine the emotional tone behind textual data. The system classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using machine learning techniques.

Sentiment analysis is widely used in product reviews, social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and opinion mining, making this project both practical and industry-relevant.
